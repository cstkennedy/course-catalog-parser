# Known Bugs

  1. There is no handling of the interchangeable (and lackadaisical) use of CS
     4xx/5xx vs CS 4xx.

  2. There is no handling of _or_ vs _and_ in prereq extraction.

  3. Prereq extraction is based purely on finding numbers that fit the regular
     expression `[A-Za-z]{2,} \d{3}[ACGHMNRTW]{0,1}(/\d{3}){0,1}`.

    - This results in listings such as `Engl 3xx to 3xx` generating both `Engl
      3xx` and `to 3xx`.

    - This results in cases (of laziness) where the subject was omitted from a
      list (e.g., `Math 102M or 103M`) being partially processed.
